# LangChain Docs

## Features

- LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).

- LangChain simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle:

    - Development

        - Build your application using LangChain's open-source building blocks and components.

        - Hit the ground running using third-party integrations and Templates.

    - Productionization: Use LangSmith to inspect, monitor and evaluate your chains, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with confidence.

    - Deployment: Turn any chain into an API with LangServe.

- Concretely, the framework consists of the following open-source libraries:

    - `langchain-core`: Base abstractions and LangChain Expression Language.

    - `langchain-community`: Third party integrations.

        - Partner packages: Some integrations have been further split into their own lightweight packages that only depend on `langchain-core`.

    - `langchain`: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.

    - `langgraph`: Build robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph.

    - `langserve`: Deploy LangChain chains as REST APIs.

    - `langsmith`: A developer platform that lets you debug, test, evaluate, and monitor LLM applications.
